    <h2>Bridging Neuroscience and AI in the Era of Digital Transformation</h2>
    <p>Large scale <a href="https://www.internationalbraininitiative.org/" target="_blank">brain research initiatives</a> are increasing around the world. Societies are becoming increasingly convinced of the necessity to understand the brain and behaviour mechanisms underlying health and disease.
      At the same time, AI and data science advancements require a deeper understanding of neurobehavioral mechanisms to create ethical, adaptive, and human-centric technologies.
Traditional neuroscience education often lacks the computational and applied dimensions needed to translate research into impactful real-world solutions.
The Digital Neuroscience Master’s program was created to bridge a critical gap at the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and human-machine interaction in the era of rapid digital transformation. 

</div>    
<img src="assets/images/Brain_Initiatives.png" alt="Neuroscience and AI integration">
<div class="text-content">
  <p>Furthermore, AI-driven applications in healthcare, education, industry, and neurotechnology are expanding, and so is the need for experts who can bridge biological intelligence with computational models.
The <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/neurotechnology-market" target="_blank">global neurotechnology market</a>  is projected to reach $22 billion by 2027, fueled by innovations in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), AI-driven diagnostics, and cognitive augmentation technologies (Precedence Research, 2024). 
Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-ai-healthcare-market/" target="_blank">AI in healthcare market</a>  is expected to surpass $10 billion by 2026, signaling an urgent need for professionals who can integrate brain-inspired AI, real-time neural data analysis, and human-centered technology design into real-world applications (Grand View research,AI In Healthcare Market Size, Share & Growth Report, 2030).

This program was designed to equip students with the skills to lead this transformation—combining neuroscientific rigor with computational innovation to develop adaptive AI systems, brain-inspired technologies, and multimodal human-machine interfaces. Graduates will be prepared to drive advancements in neurotechnology, cognitive enhancement, and AI-driven decision-making, whether in cutting-edge research, industry innovation, or ethical policy development.</p>
