  <!-- Section 1: Bridging Neuroscience and AI -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Bridging Neuroscience and AI in the Era of Digital Transformation</h2>
    <p>The Digital Neuroscience Masterâ€™s program was created to bridge a critical gap at the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and human-machine interaction in the era of rapid digital transformation. Traditional neuroscience education often lacks the computational and applied dimensions needed to translate research into impactful real-world solutions. At the same time, AI and data science advancements require a deeper understanding of neurobehavioral mechanisms to create ethical, adaptive, and human-centric technologies.

As AI-driven applications in healthcare, education, industry, and neurotechnology expand, so does the demand for experts who can bridge biological intelligence with computational models. The global neurotechnology market is projected to reach $21 billion by 2026, fueled by innovations in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), AI-driven diagnostics, and cognitive augmentation technologies (Market Research Future, 2022). Meanwhile, the AI in healthcare market is expected to surpass $187 billion by 2030, signaling an urgent need for professionals who can integrate brain-inspired AI, real-time neural data analysis, and human-centered technology design into real-world applications (Fortune Business Insights, 2023).

This program was designed to equip students with the skills to lead this transformationâ€”combining neuroscientific rigor with computational innovation to develop adaptive AI systems, brain-inspired technologies, and multimodal human-machine interfaces. Graduates will be prepared to drive advancements in neurotechnology, cognitive enhancement, and AI-driven decision-making, whether in cutting-edge research, industry innovation, or ethical policy development.</p>

  <section class="about-section alt-bg">
    <h2>From Neurons to Society: A Multiscale Approach</h2>
    <p>From Neurons to Society: A Multiscale Approach to Digital Neuroscience
A defining feature of this program is its multiscale approach to understanding cognition, behavior, and neurotechnology, spanning from single-neuron recordings to large-scale social systems.

Neuron Level: The program incorporates in vivo and in vitro single-neuron recordings, computational models of neural circuits, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to understand how fundamental neural processes give rise to cognition and perception.
Systems Level: Students gain expertise in EEG, fMRI, biosensors, and multimodal neural data analysis to explore brain dynamics in cognitive states, decision-making, and learning.
Behavioral Level: Eye-tracking, motion capture, and human-computer interaction methods allow students to study real-time neurobehavioral adaptation and cognitive workload in applied environments such as education, aviation, and high-performance sports.
Social Level: The program extends to hyperscanning and collective intelligence models, analyzing how groups of individuals collaborate, innovate, and make decisions in complex environments like digital workspaces, smart cities, and policy design.
This multilevel analysis enables graduates to translate neuroscientific knowledge into real-world applications, whether in precision healthcare, adaptive learning technologies, or social computing (MIT Technology Review, 2023).</p>

  <!-- Section 3: Collaboration with Digital Society & Digital Law -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>A Strategic Collaboration with Digital Society and Digital Law</h2>
    <p>The Digital Neuroscience Masterâ€™s program does not stand aloneâ€”it coexists alongside two key strategic programs at the University of Fribourg: Digital Society and Digital Law. These three programs create a unique interdisciplinary ecosystem where students, researchers, and industry partners can address the societal, ethical, and legal challenges of AI-driven neuroscience.

Digital Neuroscience (This Program): Focuses on the intersection of neuroscience and AI, developing adaptive neurotechnologies, brain-inspired machine learning, and cognitive augmentation tools.
Digital Society: Examines the impact of AI, automation, and digital transformation on human behavior, governance, and ethical AI implementation.
Digital Law: Provides a framework for regulating AI, neurotechnology, and digital identity, addressing questions of privacy, agency, and the legal boundaries of AI-enhanced cognition.
This triad of programs allows students to engage in interdisciplinary research, ensuring that neuroscience-driven AI innovations align with ethical, social, and legal considerations (Harvard Business Review, 2023). By integrating technical expertise with ethical foresight, graduates will be uniquely positioned to shape the future of responsible neurotechnology.</p>
